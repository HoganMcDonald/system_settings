# Code Style

- Follow existing codebase patterns before introducing new ones
- Prefer explicit over clever — future readers matter more than current writers
- Delete dead code — it lives in git history
- Remove comments that restate what code obviously does
- Keep functions focused — if it does two things, split it
- Handle errors at the appropriate level — don't swallow them silently
