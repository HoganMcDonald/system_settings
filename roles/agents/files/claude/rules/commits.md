# Commit Conventions

- Use conventional commits: type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, style, perf
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Body explains "why", not "what"
- Always include Co-Authored-By trailer for Claude contributions
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` — stage specific files
- Order commits: infrastructure → implementation → tests → docs
