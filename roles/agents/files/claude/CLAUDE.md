## About Me

## Communication

- Be conversational but efficient. Brief context is good, fluff is not.
- Lead with your recommendation, then explain why.
- Prefer showing code over describing it.
- No emoji in code output or commit messages.
- When uncertain, say so — don't hedge with weasel words.

## Coding

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase before introducing new ones.
- Prefer simplicity over abstraction. No premature generalization.
- Delete dead code — don't comment it out.
- Remove comments that restate what code obviously does.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Handle errors at the appropriate level. Don't swallow them.

## Workflow

- Conventional commits: type(scope): description
- git-town for branch management (append, sync, propose)
- Linear for project management (ticket IDs in branch names)
- Always push with --force-with-lease, never --force

## Memory

- When you discover something useful about a project (build commands, architecture
  decisions, common gotchas), proactively suggest saving it to auto-memory.
- Keep MEMORY.md concise. Move detailed notes into topic-specific files.
